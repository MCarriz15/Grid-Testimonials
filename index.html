        <p class="card_lead"> After spending next to a month trying to get this project done with a different company, and giving up because they just didn't *get* what I wanted/needed, I found This Company</p>
        <p class="card_quote">"They were wonderful to work with. We communicated easily. They totally understood what I needed. And, worked with me if there was something I didn't explain clearly. They finished several days early and designed a beautiful site for me. I will use them again and again on anything that has to do with web design! They wer very patient and great at answering questions. I look forward to working with them again. I am happy with how my site looks and everything works well. The site was finished faster than our original timeline."</p>
